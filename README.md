# PIP (Point In Polygon)

## Summary

A raycasting algorithm is used to determine if a point lies inside of a simple polygon. A simple polygon is a polygon that does not intersect with itself. A straight line from the point is drawn in any direction, and the number of intersections with the perimeter determines the state (either inside or outside the shape) of the polygon. It is first assumed that the point is outside the polygon, and then the line is drawn toward infinity. If the line does not intersect the polygon, it is outside. Every intersection changes the state of the boolean (either false -> true || true -> false by using !). An even number of intersections indicates that the line stays outside, as it was outside at first. The only issue with the algorithm is that the point cannot be directly on the edge, so a numerical tolerance is added such that the algorithm shifts the point if it is close enough to the edge.
